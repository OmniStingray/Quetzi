# Quetzi
Quetzi is a snake like game that I modified after following a tutorial.

For practice, my friend group decided to try and learn Godot Engine 4.2.1 and we decided to begin with each of us making a copy of the classic video game "Snake".  This is my version of it.

For a 2 week production deadline, we decided to first develop a GDD and then create a game to try and match the criteria we set in our GDDs. 

GDD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TASfs34BPorCc5a3IhbTuKidswI_dW1il1F6CVgCTqs/edit?usp=sharing

While this is my first game, I was not familiar with writting a GDD and just copied a template.  There are a lot of little details in the GDD which I didn't understand and just left it like it was in the template I used.

As I am not as familiar with how to use .git, I'm not sure I have done this correctly either.

The game has a few folders with the different scenes, assets, and menues.
